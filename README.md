RainCity Roasters, LLC is a small Seattle-based business that roasts and sells specialty coffee and branded merchandise through both their physical café and an online Shopify storefront. The business operates from a single physical site, which serves as their roastery, office, café, and micro-warehouse. As RainCity Roasters' online presence has grown, so has their customer base — attracting coffee enthusiasts across the U.S. and internationally, including customers from the European Union.

The company’s IT infrastructure has expanded organically to support e-commerce operations, in-store point-of-sale systems, and cloud-based productivity tools. However, as operations scale, the **IT manager has raised concerns** about the company’s ability to maintain security best practices, ensure business continuity, and meet international compliance requirements such as **PCI DSS** and **GDPR**.

To address these concerns, RainCity Roasters has initiated an **internal security assessment**. 

The results of this assessment will help RainCity Roasters better understand their current risks, avoid costly data breaches or regulatory fines, and establish a scalable security foundation to support future growth.

### Data Classification 

Although RainCity Roasters is a small business, establishing a basic data classification framework helps the company understand which information assets require the highest level of protection.

GRC data classification is a framework for organizing and protecting data based on its sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and business value. This enables organizations to manage risk and ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and ISO 27001. 

The process typically involves classifying data into sensitivity levels: 

| Classification | Description | Examples | Handling Requirements |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Public** | Information approved for public use and sharing. | Website content, product descriptions, marketing materials | No restrictions |
| **Internal** | Operational data intended for internal staff and trusted partners. | SOPs, supplier lists, internal communications | Authentication required; limited sharing |
| **Confidential** | Sensitive business or customer data whose exposure could harm operations or reputation. | Customer orders, financial data, employee info | MFA required; encryption at rest and in transit |
| **Restricted** | Highly sensitive or regulated data requiring the strongest controls. | Payment card information (PCI), EU customer data (GDPR) | Strict need-to-know basis; encryption, monitoring, and access logging |

### Risk Assessment 

Based on the assets identified above, the following key risks were evaluated for RainCity Roasters and formatted into the Risk Table below. 

Assets were evaluated using qualitative ratings Likelihood (the probability of a threat occurring) and Impact (the potential effect on business operations or data), resulting in their Risk Level. 

| ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Notes / Mitigation |
|----|------------------|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------------|
| R-01 | Weak MFA enforcement for cloud accounts | High | High | **High** | Implement MFA for all users, especially admin accounts |
| R-02 | Lack of formal backup and recovery plan | Medium | High | **High** | Develop BCP/DRP and schedule regular backup testing |
| R-03 | GDPR non-compliance for EU customer data | Medium | High | **High** | Create documented process for DSRs and data retention |
| R-04 | Unpatched legacy system vulnerabilities | Medium | Medium | **Medium** | Decommission or isolate end-of-life systems |
| R-05 | Insufficient logging/monitoring | Low | Medium | **Medium** | Centralize log collection for Shopify, Workspace, and network devices |

#### Risk Description 

Overall, RainCity Roasters' **risk score** is *High (8/10)* due to an inadequate management of assets, inconsistent control implementation, and a lack of adherence to compliance best practices. 

#### Risk Management 

Immediate priorities include enforcing strong authentication practices, formalizing incident and business continuity plans, and defining vendor compliance responsibilities. 

These findings form the basis for the subsequent Controls and Compliance Checklist, which evaluates whether RainCity Roasters currently meets essential security control requirements.

#### Additional Notes

In Cybersecurity, control types are commonly classified into three domains:
| Control Domain | Example |
|----------------|----------|
| Administrative | Policies, training, vendor management |
| Technical | MFA, firewalls, encryption, backups |
| Physical | Locks, CCTV, visitor logs |

Control types (which defend and protect assets) include, but are not limited to:
| Control Type | Description | Examples |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Preventative** | Designed to stop an incident or security event from occurring. | Firewalls, MFA, access control policies, employee training, physical locks |
| **Detective** | Identify or alert when an incident has occurred or is in progress. | Intrusion detection systems (IDS), log monitoring, security cameras |
| **Corrective** | Mitigate damage and restore systems or data after an incident. | Backups, patching, disaster recovery procedures, incident response plans |
| **Deterrent** | Discourage malicious behavior or potential attacks before they happen. | Security awareness signage, warnings, enforcement policies, visible security cameras |

Additionally, the IT manager should consider utilizing the NIST CSF framework to better manage RainCity Roasters' cybersecurity risk. The phases of the NIST CSF framework are as follows:
- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover
